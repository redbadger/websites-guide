# 🖼️ ✂️️ Using Preview to edit images

## What we’ll do
Make an image 🖼️ the correct size ✂️️ for a website, using:

An Image we want to use online:<br>
![Group of Red Badger emloyees in Krakow at night](https://github.com/redbadger/websites-guide/blob/images/assets/edit-image-03.png "Group of Red Badger emloyees in Krakow at night")

A Template image (the correct size for a certain page or part of a page):<br>
![Black rectangle template](https://github.com/redbadger/websites-guide/blob/images/assets/edit-image-14.png "Black rectangle template")

Some software (Preview):<br>
![Logo for Preview software](https://github.com/redbadger/websites-guide/blob/images/assets/edit-image-05.jpg "Logo for Preview software")

## How to do it
Double click the template to open it in Preview [image]

Double click your chosen image to open it in Preview [image].<br>
⌘ A (Select all)<br>
⌘ C (Copy)

Click into the template<br>
⌘ V (Paste)

Now your image is inside the template in Preview [image]. The image is probably too big 🎪 for the template so we need to shrink it and position it.

Left-click and pull [image] the image within the template until you can see the blue dot on the top right corner.<br>

Left-click and drag [image] the blue dot on the corner to the bottom left. This will shrink your image.<br>

Then left-click on the actual image and pull [image] it back into the visible part of the template.<br>

Repeat![Repeat icon](https://github.com/redbadger/websites-guide/blob/images/assets/edit-image-17.png "Repeat icon"): Left-click and drag [image] the blue dot on the corner to the bottom left. This will shrink your image.
Then left-click on the actual image and pull [image] it back into the visible part of the template.

Until your image is the desired size. 

Now position [image] your image to your chosen composition.<br>
