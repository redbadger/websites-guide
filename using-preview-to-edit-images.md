# 🖼️ ✂️️ Using Preview to edit images

## What we’ll do
Make an image 🖼️ the correct size ✂️️ for a website, using:

An Image we want to use online:<br>
!(

A Template image (the correct size for a certain page or part of a page):<br>
[image]

Some software (Preview):<br>
[image]

## How to do it
Double click the template to open it in Preview [image]

Double click your chosen image to open it in Preview [image].<br>
⌘ A (Select all)<br>
⌘ C (Copy)

Click into the template<br>
⌘ V (Paste)

Now your image is inside the template in Preview [image]. The image is probably too big 🎪 for the template so we need to shrink it and position it.

Left-click and pull [image] the image within the template until you can see the blue dot on the top right corner.<br>
[image]

Left-click and drag [image] the blue dot on the corner to the bottom left. This will shrink your image.<br>
[image]

Then left-click on the actual image and pull [image] it back into the visible part of the template.<br>
[image]<br>
[image]

Repeat: Left-click and drag [image] the blue dot on the corner to the bottom left. This will shrink your image.
Then left-click on the actual image and pull [image] it back into the visible part of the template.

Until your image is the desired size. 

Now position [image] your image to your chosen composition.<br>
[image]

Save 💾 your file:<br>
File > Export<br>
[image]

Export As: [Name your file]<br>
Where: [Choose a destination folder]<br>
[image]

Format: <br>
[JPEG] for photos<br>
[PNG] for logos and illustrations

[JPEG]<br>
Quality: Should ideally be about 75%, no less than 50%<br>
File Size: Should be as small as possible whilst maintaining a good quality.<br> 
Under 100KB = 👍👍👍<br>
100KB - 200KB = 👍👍<br>
200KB - 1MB = 👍<br>
Over 1MB = 👎🚨

_1000 Bytes (B) = 1 Kilobyte (KB)_<br>
_1000KB = 1 Megabyte (MB)_<br>
_1000MB = 1 Gigabyte (GB)_<br>
