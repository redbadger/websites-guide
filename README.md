###Introduction
Hi there!

This book serves as a guide to the sometimes confusing world of Prismic, Cloudinary, Website and React.London.

[Prismic](https://prismic.io/) is our backend/database for Website Next and React.London (see below). For the non-techies among you, Prismic is used to input information that we would like to display on our websites. This information includes news items, events, employees, blog posts etc.

[Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) is a image hosting website where we store all the images used on our websites.

[Website Next](https://red-badger.com/) is Red Badger's official website.

[React.London](https://react.london) is Red Badger's official website for the React meetups held monthly. This website also contains information about the upcoming conference.

###Getting Started

To get started, you need to get access to both Prismic and Cloudinary. Message any of the members on the #badger-labs team and they should be able to assist you.

Each of the tasks you may wish to do are listed as chapters. Don't hesitate to contact any of the #badger-labs team for assistance! If you find any of the steps confusing, please let us know so we can make this documentation easier to follow!

###Testing
It's a good idea to test your changes locally because your copy might look right on `github` but not when run through `gitbook`. To launch `gitbook` locally, run the following commands and then open http://localhost:4000.
```
npm install
npm run build
```
