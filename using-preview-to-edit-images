# Using Preview to edit images

## What we’ll do
Make an image 🖼️ the correct size ✂️️ for a website, using:

An Image we want to use online:
[image]

A Template image (the correct size for a certain page or part of a page):
[image]

Some software (Preview):
[image]

## How to do it
Double click the template to open it in Preview [image]

Double click your chosen image to open it in Preview [image].
⌘ A (Select all)
⌘ C (Copy)

Click into the template
⌘ V (Paste)

Now your image is inside the template in Preview [image]. The image is probably too big 🎪 for the template so we need to shrink it and position it.

Left-click and pull [image] the image within the template until you can see the blue dot on the top right corner.
[image]

Left-click and drag [image] the blue dot on the corner to the bottom left. This will shrink your image.
[image]

Then left-click on the actual image and pull [image] it back into the visible part of the template.

[image]

Repeat: Left-click and drag [image] the blue dot on the corner to the bottom left. This will shrink your image.
Then left-click on the actual image and pull [image] it back into the visible part of the template.

Until your image is the desired size. 

Now position [image] your image to your chosen composition.
