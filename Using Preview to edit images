What we’ll do
Make an image 🖼️ the correct size ✂️️ for a website, using:

An Image we want to use online:
[image]

A Template image (the correct size for a certain page or part of a page):
[image]

Some software (Preview):
[image]

How to do it
Double click the template to open it in Preview [image]

Double click your chosen image to open it in Preview [image].
⌘ A (Select all)
⌘ C (Copy)

Click into the template
⌘ V (Paste)

Now your image is inside the template in Preview [image]. The image is probably too big 🎪 for the template so we need to shrink it and position it.
